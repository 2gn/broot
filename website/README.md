Broot's website is live at https://dystroy.org/broot

It's built using [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/)

The current version of the site uses mkdocs verion 1.0.4 and doesn't properly render on versions 1.1.x (this should be changed)

To test it locally, cd to the website directory then

	mkdocs serve

To build it, do

	mkdocs build
