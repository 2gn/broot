.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBbroot\fR lets you explore file hierarchies with a tree-like view, manipulate files, launch actions, and define your own shortcuts.
.PP
\fBbroot\fR is best launched as \fBbr\fR: this shell function gives you access to more commands, especially \fIcd\fR. The \fBbr\fR shell function is interactively installed on first \fBbroot\fR launch.
.PP
Flags and options can be classically passed on launch but also written in the configuration file. Each flag has a counter-flag so that you can cancel at command line a flag which has been set in the configuration file.

.SH BUGS
.PP
.B broot
is known to be slow on most \fIWindows\fR installations.
.PP
On unix and mac platforms, most problems you may encounter are related to some terminals or terminal multiplexers which either intercepts some standard TTY instructions or break buffering or size querying. The list of shortcuts you can define in the config file is thus dependent of your system.
